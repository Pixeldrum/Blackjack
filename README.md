Project3
For this project, we have created an online blackjack game. It uses a login system which communicates with a mySQL database, allowing us to track the user's score. We also have a leaderboard, so players can see how they compare to others.
Created by William Wantuch, Liam Walsh, and Alan Yao

Much of this code is taken from https://github.com/liamtw22/Project3, where the project originally created. I made some touch ups here and there, and the same exact code can be found on that project page under the "ayao" branch.

A much more detailed summary of what the project is about can be found in the "Project 3 Summary.pdf" in the repository, with pictures and group responsibilities.
